<h1>I am currently studying in a professional doctorate program at the University of Edinburgh. I aspire to reduce emotional distress, enhance psychological well-being, and promote a positive perception of mental health. I strive to uplift lives because I truly believe that every individual deserves a better and healthier life. My life goal is to help people gain self-reliance, dignity and hope through therapy.My approach is psychodynamic and person-centred. In fact, I don’t like to categorise. So more accurately speaking, my approach is relational. It is two people sitting together trying to discover who we really are, what is perpepuating our dysfunctional thoughts or behaviours, and what is hindering us from self-actualisation and feeling fulfilled. Psychotherapy, in my opinion, is not about fixing something. It’s all about developing our self-awareness, the capacity to reflect on ourselves and to make better decisions in life, without repeating our unhealthy patterns.We together try to make sense of something painful and unbearable, create meanings out of it, and thus experience psychic transformation. Hmmm.....it might sound vague. To give you an analogy, imagine both of us trying to map a dark foggy city together with a compass and find the way out. Though it might be scary, it is a transformative journey. In our work, this is a safe space for us to let this exquisite alchemical reaction happen. It is simple......but deep…...very deep......This is a poem I wrote at the beginning of my training. It basically sums up what is possibly going on between us.𝘛𝘸𝘰 𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘺 𝘦𝘨𝘨𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘪𝘳𝘥’𝘴 𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘋𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘚𝘱𝘦𝘢𝘬 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘶𝘯𝘴𝘱𝘦𝘢𝘬𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘍𝘦𝘦𝘭 𝘵𝘩𝘦 “𝘶𝘯𝘧𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦”𝘍𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘶𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘶𝘯𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘶𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘥𝘌𝘹𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘶𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦Regarding my research, I am particularly interested in internalised racism, colonisation, and dreams. I am exploring what it means to be a Hongkonger with Chinese ethnicity living in Britain through my own dreams and social dreaming. My research is still in its infancy. </h1>
